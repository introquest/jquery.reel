jQuery Reel Dual-Orbit Sequence Object Movie Example
====================================================

Here the dual-orbit setup is showcased. Dual orbit object movies feature
one horizontal and one vertical orbit around the object in one. It allows
users to translate the movie from horizontal to vertical (and vice versa)
when within 3 frames from the starting frame. This sequence is also
animated with one revolution per ~1.3 seconds, is shot in clockwise
fashion and its vertical organization is inversed as opposed to the
default expectations.

It also features a text-less annotation taking form of a green box in
the upper right corner of the image visible only at the center point (on
frames 1, 2, 3, 9 and 10) and at the same time demonstrates how easy CSS
styling can be applied.
