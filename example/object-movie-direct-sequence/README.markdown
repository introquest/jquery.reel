jQuery Reel Direct Sequence Object Movie Example
================================================

This example demonstrates the old-style sequence definition using the
`images` option, which accepts an Array of URLs (in this case the four
Reel badges). At start it waits for 1 second and then animates making
2 full revolutions per second.

Note that the very same result could be achieved using
`sequence: "badge-#.gif"` instead of the `images` option.


Options Employed In This Example
--------------------------------

- [delay](http://reel360.org/reel#delay)
- [images](http://reel360.org/reel#images)
- [speed](http://reel360.org/reel#speed)

See the complete source of [index.html](index.html) for full
implementation.
