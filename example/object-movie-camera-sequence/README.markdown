jQuery Reel Bare Camera Sequence Object Movie Example
=====================================================

This example demonstrates a completely bare object movie sequence
working directly with files produced by a digital camera (in this case
12 shots; DSCN0691.JPG, DSCN0692.JPG, ..., DSCN0702.JPG) without any
further naming care (it is however advisable to resize your camera images
first). Not limited to just object movies.
